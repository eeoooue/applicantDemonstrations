  <h2>Moving Vertices in the Vertex Shader</h2>
  <p>Once we've loaded data onto the card and made a draw call to send that
  data down the pipeline the vertex data arrives at the vertex shader. The vertex shader
  is run once for every vertex that was sent down the pipe, but remember, the power of
  the graphics card is that it can process thousands of vertices at the same time!</p><p>Here, we're
  going to edit the shader so that we can move the camera around the model. Actually,
  instead of moving the camera we're going to make it seem like the camera is moving by
  moving everything else around the camera - so instead of moving the camera to the left
  we'll move everything else to the right. To do this in the vertex shader we need
  to subtract the camera position from each vertex position.</p>
	<div class="tryIt">
	<h2><img src="assets/cogs.png"/>Try it yourself!</h2><p>Change the line that says:</p>
	<pre>gl_Position = vec4(a_position, 1.0);</pre>
	<p>to</p>
	<pre>gl_Position = vec4(a_position - u_cameraPosition, 1.0);</pre>
	<p>then click update.</p>
	<p>Clicking w, a, s and d should now move the camera in the appropriate direction.</p>

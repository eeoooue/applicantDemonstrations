	<p>The difference is impressive, and one of the technologies that contributed to this is dedicated graphics hardware.</p>
	<h1>Welcome to this WebGL Demonstration</h1>
    <p>This <i>brief</i> overview of graphics hardware has been created to give you an interactive experience that allows you to experiment with some exciting technology in an accessible.</p>
    <p>Throughout the demonstration you will have clear instructions on what to do to get the desired effect, whilst also having freedom to experiment with other things to help you understand what is going on.</p>
    <p>In this demonstration we will use WebGL based examples to run code from within the browser on your graphics card. You will edit some of the code to add a first person camera so that you can explore a scene, add per-pixel lighting to the scene.</p>	
	<h1 style="color:red;">DON'T PANIC!</h1>
	<p>This is based on content we usually cover in the <b>Second Year</b>.</p>
	<p>The will be some code and some maths. As part of your degree we will cover both the code and the maths in far greater depth.</p>
	<p>Just relax, and have fun! and if you have any feedback I would love to hear it.</p>

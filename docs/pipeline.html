			<h1>The Graphics Pipeline</h1>
			<p>In graphics there are very many independent calculations going on to create a scene.</p>
			<p>Often, the computer is doing the same calculations with different bits of data. For example, all the
				points (or
				vertices) that
				make up a model could be moved to the right place in a 3D scene, or all the pixels that make up a
				triangle could
				be coloured using the same lighting model.</p>
			<p>It doesn't matter which calculations are done first. They could be done in any order, or they could be
				done
				<b><i>all at the same time</i></b>
			</p>
			<p>This is how your graphics hardware works. It can perform the same calculations on thousands of different
				pieces
				of data at the same time.</p>
			<p>Originally the <b><i>Massively Parallelised</i></b> architecture was limited and used a <b><i>fixed
						function
						pipeline</i></b>, but now we have much more
				control over how the pipeline is created, and the code that is run on the graphics hardware. So much so
				that we
				can now
				exploit this hardware for all sorts of non-graphics related tasks.</p>
			<p>Today we're going to look at three parts of the process. They are:</p>
			<p>1. Loading data into graphics buffers.</p>
			<p>2. Moving vertices around in 3D space.</p>
			<p>3. Calculating what colour individual pixels should be.</p>

	<h1>Let There Be Light!</h1>
	<p>After the vertex shader the newly transformed vertices are group into triangles, and
		sent to the rasterizer, which splits the triangles into pixels. Then, for every pixel in the
		scene the pixel shader is run. Again, the graphics card enables this process to be executed for thousands of
		pixels at the same time.</p>
	<p>Here the program has been set up so that we know the normal vector for each pixel. The normal
		vector is a vector that points straight out of the surface. At the moment this vector is being used
		to colour the model, but we're going to adapt the pixel shader to add some moody lighting to the scene.</p>
	<p>To do this, we're simply going to pick a direction for the light, and use a special thing called
		a dot product to scale the amount of light we apply to each pixel. This simulates diffuse light from a far away
		source, like the sun.</p>

		<p>Change the line that says:</p>
		<pre>gl_FragColor = vec4(v_normal * 0.5 + 0.5, 1.0);</pre>
		<p>to</p>
		<pre>vec3 lightDirection = vec3(1,0,0);
	
float diff = max(dot(v_normal, normalize(lightDirection)), 0.0);
	
gl_FragColor = vec4(diff, diff, diff, 1.0);</pre>
		<p>then click update.</p>
		<p>Experiment by changing the lightDirection to different sets of three numbers.</p>
		<p>You can also add some colour by multiplying a colour by the diffuse scalar.
		<pre>gl_FragColor = vec4(diff * vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), 1.0);</pre>
